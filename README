SBan is an automated log parsing and banning  script. It does mostly the same as familiar fail2ban script, but has some other features which I haven't found in fail2ban

It uses a separate rules file, in which you can declare the file, the regexp, the time (count) settings, and the command used to ban the IP, person, or whatever.

You can read more about the rules file in the sample rules file provided with the script

The script is still at developement, so any suggestions and bug commisions will be appreciated.
